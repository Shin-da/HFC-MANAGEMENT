# Database Restructuring Guide for Henrich Food Corps

## Introduction

This document provides guidance on implementing the database schema improvements for the Henrich Food Corps management system. The changes address identified issues with table relationships, normalize the data structure, and improve overall database integrity.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Redundant Tables and Data Duplication**
   - Consolidated multiple user-related tables (`account_request`, `account_requests`, `approved_account`)
   - Eliminated duplicate entries in tables
   - Created a proper history tracking table

2. **Missing Foreign Key Relationships**
   - Added essential relationships between tables:
     - Customer and order tables
     - Order and order line items
     - Product and inventory tables
     - Branch and inventory relationship

3. **Inconsistent Primary Keys**
   - Fixed non-unique primary keys in various tables
   - Ensured AUTO_INCREMENT is properly configured

4. **Data Integrity Improvements**
   - Added proper constraints to enforce data validity
   - Created indexes for common query patterns
   - Added appropriate ON DELETE actions for foreign keys

## Implementation Instructions

### Preparation Steps

1. **Backup Your Database**
   ```sql
   mysqldump -u [username] -p dbhenrichfoodcorps > dbhenrichfoodcorps_backup_[date].sql
   ```

2. **Review the SQL Script**
   - Open and review `db_schema_fixes.sql` to understand the changes
   - The script includes backup tables creation before any changes

### Implementation Process

1. **Apply in a Testing Environment First**
   - Create a duplicate database for testing
   - Run the script on the test database
   - Verify application functionality

2. **Production Implementation**
   - Schedule maintenance window
   - Run the script in sections:
     1. Backup section
     2. User tables fixes
     3. Customer table fixes
     4. Order tables fixes
     5. Inventory tables fixes
     6. Indexes and views creation

3. **Post-Implementation Verification**
   - Test all application functionality
   - Verify data integrity
   - Run test queries against new views

### Potential Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Constraint violations during foreign key creation | Run data cleanup queries provided in the script first |
| Duplicate data when consolidating user tables | The script includes checks to prevent duplicates |
| Application code incompatibilities | Update application code to match new schema structure |

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Improved Data Integrity**
   - Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity
   - Proper data types and constraints prevent invalid data

2. **Better Performance**
   - Added indexes on frequently queried columns
   - Optimized table structures reduce query complexity

3. **Simplified Maintenance**
   - Consolidated tables are easier to maintain
   - Properly defined relationships make schema changes safer

4. **Enhanced Reporting Capabilities**
   - New views provide better analytics options
   - Normalized structure allows for more flexible reporting

## Application Code Updates

After implementing the database changes, you may need to update application code in the following areas:

1. **User Management**
   - Update user creation, approval, and management code to use the unified `users` table
   - Modify account request process to use status flags instead of separate tables

2. **Order Processing**
   - Ensure order creation code handles the new foreign key relationships
   - Update order queries to use the proper JOIN patterns

3. **Inventory Management**
   - Modify inventory update code to handle constraints
   - Update stock movement tracking to use proper references

## Monitoring and Maintenance

After implementation:

1. Monitor application performance and database query execution times
2. Check error logs for any SQL issues
3. Consider implementing a regular database maintenance schedule
4. Review and update documentation to reflect the new schema
